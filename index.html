				Hi.  I'm Drew.
				
			</header>

			<main>
				I'm a coding student at Skillcrush.  I'm learning how to code HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  I like the idea of working remotely, which drew me to web development, initially, but the more I get into it, the more I'm finding I genuinely like it.
			</main>

			<div class="div-1">
				I was born and raised in Edmonds, WA.  I grew up there for 11 years then moved to Redmond.  From there I moved to Bellevue and went to HS there.  I've lived on the eastside for my entire life.

			</div>

			<div class="div-2">
				I started college in 2004 and graduated from the University of Washington in 2008 with a degree in Business Administration.  I enjoyed business school but only studied it because I didn't know what else to study.
			</div>

			<div class="div-3">
				I've worked in the restaurant industry my whole life.  I loved it up until arouind the arge of 38 when my body started tiring of walking 4 to 6 miles per shift.  The older i got, the more my body hurt.
